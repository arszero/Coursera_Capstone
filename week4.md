### CAPSTONE PROJECT: BATTLE OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS
#### 1. Introduction and Business Problem
* A famous fast food chain wants to open a new branch in Toronto.
* The customer requested us to find the best area to place the new store.
* We need to choose a place that has a small number of competitors and a larges number of potential customers.
* We assume more offices/schools will bring more fast food customers, bacause students tend to like fast food and company employees usually take fast food for lunch. And it is better to choose a place has less fast food restaurants since there will be less competiitors.

#### 2. Data
We need the following data to solve the problem:
* The Neighbourhood/Latitude/Longitude/Postcode data which can be consolidated from:
    * Wikipedia Toronto postcode/neighbourhood data: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
    * csv file that has the geographical coordinates of each postal code: http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data
* We will obtain the following venues data from Foursquare :
    * the fast food restaurants in the neighbourhood
    * the high schools in the neighbourhood
    * the universities in the neighbourhood
    * the offices in the neighbourhood
* We will then leverage the data to determine which Neighbourhood is the best location for the new branch.
